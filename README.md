This project is a certification assignment from a Data Science and Machine Learning Program by Edureka, focused on analyzing data for a travel aggregator startup named "MyNextBooking." The platform aggregates travel booking options from major players like Yatra, MMT, and Goibibo, enabling users to compare prices and book journeys more efficiently. As part of the project, a variety of analytical tasks are undertaken, including determining distinct counts of bookings, sessions, and searches; exploring user behavior such as sessions with multiple bookings; and identifying trends such as the busiest days of the week and most popular routes. Additionally, the project involves aggregating financial data per service, visualizing trends through time series and heatmaps, and calculating the overall booking to search ratio (oBSR) on a monthly and weekly basis. This comprehensive analysis not only provides valuable insights into customer behavior and booking patterns but also helps the startup optimize its services in a competitive market.
